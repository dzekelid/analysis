  Startup Metrics for Pirates talk by Dave McClure, Pirate Metrics tracks Acquisitions
  (new user signups) Activations (a user uses your product) Retentions (a user continues
  to use your product) Referrals (a user refers other users) and Revenue (a user pays
  for your service.)By tracking these key events, Pirate Metrics can search for patterns
  in your subscribers&#8217; behavior, and then suggest a course of action for improving
